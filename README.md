fromExtrusionToLasercut
=======================

This Python is for running in Rhinoceros 5.0.

It takes a flat site of buildings, which are extrusion, to slabs, which will be stacked to make the buildings.

A compact lasercut file is generated, which is intended to minimise the empty space of lascercut material.
